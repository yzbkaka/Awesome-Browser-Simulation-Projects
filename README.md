## ℹ️ About

This repository maintains a list of "unblocked" browser-based projects that have migrated away from legacy Flash technology. All listed projects utilize modern HTML5/Canvas rendering engines, ensuring compatibility with current browsers (Chrome 80+, Firefox ESR, Edge) without requiring external plugins.

**Key Criteria for Inclusion:**
*   **No Plugins**: Must run natively in the browser.
*   **Lightweight**: Initial payload < 15MB for fast loading on slow connections.
*   **Persistence**: Supports `localStorage` for saving state.

## 🚀 Project List

| Project Name | Engine | Type | Status | Access Point |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Vex 4** | HTML5 / Canvas | Physics Platformer | ✅ Unblocked | **[Launch Project](https://www.mirazone.site/vex-4)** |

### Detailed Descriptions

#### [Vex 4](https://www.mirazone.site/vex-4)
*   **Description**: A vector-based parkour simulation featuring advanced collision detection and momentum physics.
*   **Optimization**: Optimized for 60 FPS on non-GPU accelerated hardware.
*   **Network Note**: Uses standard HTTPS port 443; typically bypasses educational firewalls.

## 🛠 Usage

No installation or compilation is required for these projects. They are hosted as static web containers.

1.  Select a project from the list above.
2.  Click the **Launch Project** link.
3.  The simulation will initialize directly in your browser viewport.

*Note: For best performance on Chromebooks, close unnecessary background tabs.*

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find a broken link or want to suggest a new HTML5 simulation project:
